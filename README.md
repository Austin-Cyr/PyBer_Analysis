# PyBer_Analysis
Week_5_PyBer Module

## Overview of the Analysis:

- The following analysis summarizes the ride-sharing data from two data sets, one with city data info and a second with driver level detail, at PyBer Ride-Sharing Co. by city type. The data also demonstrates the differences in ride-sharing total weekly fares by city type. The purpose was to analyze the data and produce 3 business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

## Results:

- The PyBer ridesharing data from the dataframe conveys some key differences between the three city types that the company services. The first is that as the city type grows larger in population, the total rides grow significantly. This shows that that there is greater demand for its services in the larger city. The larger city types also happen to have a greater number of total drivers too. While the data and this analysis does not create a causal relationship, it can be inferred that the greater demand for riders drives the need for opportunity for drivers to earn money.

- The data also shows a difference in total fare collection, and average far per rider and per driver. It is easy to see that with a greater number of rides, the total fare is greater. However, it is interesting that the average fare per ride is higher in the rural cities. This could be becuase of the greater distances that some rides may be or that the fares need to be higher to attract the drivers. 

- Additionally, the average fare per driver is also greater in the rural cities than the urban cities. This results from a compoundment of the average fare per ride and ratio of total rides to drivers. 

- The Total Fare by City Type per week line chart supports the total fare differential between city types. Based on a first observation, there does not seem to be signficant trend difference between either of the city types and each city type seems to increase or decrease in total fare amounts on different weeks.

## Summary: 

- Since the three distinct city types show different results with the totals, averages and trends, there may be a business need to address these disparities. Since the rural areas seem to earn a higher average fare per driver and have few derivers per ride, I would suggest the business focus on adding additional drivers to the rural areas. This may help attract more business and earn fares at a higher fare which will drive top line revenue. And as an opposite measure to this, I would suggest that the company reduce its marketing efforts in the urban cities since each driver attracts less fare per driver than rural/suburban areas and thus theoretically incurs a higher cost to onboard each driver for less fare. And the last recommendation I would make would be to increase marketing in the urban cities to attract and drive business to where the company had amply driver supply to support the added growth.
