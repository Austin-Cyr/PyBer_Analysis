## Overview of the Analysis

- The following analysis summarizes the ride-sharing data from two data sets, one with city data info and a second with driver level detail, at PyBer Ride-Sharing Co. by city type. The data also demonstrates the differences in ride-sharing total weekly fares by city type. The purpose was to analyze the data and produce 3 business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

- The PyBer ridesharing data from the dataframe conveys some key differences between the three city types that the company services. The first is that as the city type grows larger in population, the total rides grow significantly. This shows that that there is greater demand for its services in the larger city. The larger city types also happen to have a greater number of total drivers too. While the data and this analysis does not create a causal relationship, it can be inferred that the greater demand for riders drives the need for opportunity for drivers to earn money.

- The data also shows a difference in total fare collection, and average far per rider and per driver. It is easy to see that with a greater number of rides, the total fare is greater. However, it is interesting that the average fare per ride is higher in the rural cities. This could be becuase of the greater distances that some rides may be or that the fares need to be higher to attract the drivers. 

- Additionally, the average fare per driver is also greater in the rural cities than the urban cities. This results from a compoundment of the average fare per ride and ratio of total rides to drivers. 

- The Total Fare by City Type per week line chart supports the total fare differential between city types. Based on a first observation, there does not seem to be signficant trend difference between either of the city types and each city type seems to increase or decrease in total fare amounts on different weeks.
