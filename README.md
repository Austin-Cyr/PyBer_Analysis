## Overview of the Analysis

- The following analysis summarizes the ride-sharing data from two data sets, one with city data info and a second with driver level detail, at PyBer Ride-Sharing Co. by city type. The data also demonstrates the differences in ride-sharing total weekly fares by city type. The purpose was to analyze the data and produce 3 business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

- The PyBer ridesharing data from the dataframe conveys some key differences between the three city types that the company services. The first is that as the city type grows larger in population, the total rides grow significantly. This shows that that there is greater demand for its services in the larger city. The larger city types also happen to have a greater number of total drivers too. While the data and this analysis does not create a causal relationship, it can be inferred that the greater demand for riders drives the need for opportunity for drivers to earn money.
